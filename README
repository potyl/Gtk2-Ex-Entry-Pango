Gtk2-Ex-Entry-Pango
===================

Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango is a Gtk2::Entry that can accept Pango markup as input
(for more information about Pango text markup language see 
http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html).

This widget allows for the text data to be entered either through the normal methods
provided by Gtk2::Entry or to use the method set_markup. It's possible to switch
between two methods for applying the text. The standard Gtk2::Entry methods will
always apply a text without styles while set_markup() will use a style.
