=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango - Gtk2 Entry that accepts Pango markup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango;
	
	
	# You can use any method defined in Gtk2::Entry or set_markup()
	my $entry = Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango->new();
	$entry->set_markup('<i>Pan</i><b>go</b> is <span color="red">fun</span>');
	
	
	# Create a simple search field
	my $search = Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango->new();
	$search->set_empty_markup("<span color='grey' size='smaller'>Search...</span>");
	
	
	# Realtime validation - accept only ASCII letters
	my $validation = Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango->new();
	$validation->signal_connect(changed => sub {
		my $text = $validation->get_text;
	
		# Validate the entry's text
		if ($text =~ /^[a-z]*$/) {
			return;
		}
	
		# Mark the string as being erroneous
		my $escaped = Glib::Markup::escape_text($text);
		$validation->set_markup("<span underline='error' underline_color='red'>$escaped</span>");
		$validation->signal_stop_emission_by_name('changed');
	});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango> is a C<Gtk2::Entry> that can accept Pango markup for
various purposes (for more information about Pango text markup language see 
L<http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html>).

The widget allows Pango markup to be used for input as an alternative to
C<set_text> or for setting a default value when the widget is empty. The default
value when empty is ideal for standalone text entries that have no accompanying
label (such as a text field for a search).

This widget allows for the text data to be entered either through the normal
methods provided by C<Gtk2::Entry> or to use the method L</set_markup>. It's
possible to switch between two methods for applying the text. The standard
C<Gtk2::Entry> methods will always apply a text without styles while
C<set_markup()> will use a style.

The widget C<Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango> keeps track of which style to apply by
listening to the signal I<changed>. This has some important consequences. If an
instance needs to provide it's own I<changed> listener that calls
C<set_markup()> then the signal I<changed> has to be stopped otherwise the
layout will be lost. The following code snippet show how to stop the emission of
the I<changed> signal:

	my $entry = Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango->new();
	$entry->signal_connect(changed => sub {
		
		# Validate the text 
		my $text = $entry->get_text;
		if (validate($text)) {
				return;
		}
		
		# Mark the text as being erroneous
		my $escaped = Glib::Markup::escape_text($text);
		$entry->set_markup("<span underline='error' underline_color='red'>$escaped</span>");
		$entry->signal_stop_emission_by_name('changed');
	});

Another important thing to note is that C<Gtk2::Entry::set_text()> will not
update it's content if the input text is the same as the text already stored.
This means that if set text is called with the same string it will not emit the
signal I<changed> and the widget will not pickup that the markup styles have to
be dropped. This is true even it the string displayed uses markup, as long as
the contents are the same C<set_text()> will not make an update. The method
L</clear_markup> can be used for safely clearing the markup text.

=head1 CAVEATS

A C<Gtk2::Entry> keeps track of both the text and the markup styles (Pango
layout) as two different entities . The markup styles are just styles applied
over the internal text. Because of this it's possible to have the widget display
a different text than the one stored internally.

Because a C<Gtk2::Entry> keeps track of both the text and the style layouts.
It's important to always keep track of both. If the styles and text are not
totally synchronized strange things will happen. In the worst case it's even
possible to make the C<Gtk2::Entry> widget display a different text than the one
stored (the text value). This can make things more confusing.

This widget tries as hard as possible to synchronize the text data and the
layout data.

=head2 set_markup

Sets the text of the entry using Pango markup. This method can die if the markup
is not valid and fails to parse (see L<Gtk2::Pango/parse_markup>).

Parameters:

=over

=item * $markup

The text to add to the entry, the text is expected to be using Pango markup.
This means that even if no markup is used special characters like E<lt>, E<gt>,
&, ' and " need to be escaped. Keep in mind that Pango markup is a subset of
XML.

You might want to use the following code snippet for escaping the characters:

	$entry->set_markup(
		sprintf "The <i>%s</i> <b>%s</b> fox <sup>%s</sup> over the lazy dog",
			map { Glib::Markup::escape_text($_) } qw(quick brown jumps)
	);

=cut

sub set_markup {
	my $self = shift;
	my ($markup) = @_;

	# NOTE: In order to have the markup applied properly both the widget's
	# internal text value and the Pango style have to be applied. Calling
	# $self->get_layout->set_markup($markup); is not enough as it will only apply
	# the markup and render the text in $markup but will not update the internal
	# text representation of the widget.
	#
	# For instance, if the text within the markup differs from the actual text in
	# the Gtk2::Entry and changes in width there will be some problems. Sure the
	# entry's text will be rendered properly but the entry will not have the right
	# data within it's buffer. This means that $self->get_text() will still return
	# the old text even though the widget displays the new string. Furthermore,
	# the widget will fail to edit text because the cursor could be placed at a
	# position that's further than the actual data in the widget.
	#
	# To solve this problem the new text has to be added to the entry and the
	# style has to be applied afterwards. The text is added to the widget through
	# $self->set(text => $text); by the method apply_markup() while the styles are
	# applied each time that the widget is rendered (see callback_changed()).
	$self->set(markup => $markup);
}



=head2 clear_markup

Clears the Pango markup that was applied to the widget. This method can be
called even if no markup was applied previously.

B<NOTE>: That this method will emit the signal I<markup-changed>. 

=cut

sub clear_markup {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->set_markup(undef);
}



=head2 set_empty_markup

Sets the Pango markup that was applied to the widget when there's the entry is
empty. This method can die if the markup is not valid and fails to parse
(see L<Gtk2::Pango/parse_markup>).

C<NOTE:> Setting an empty markup string has no effect on C<get_text>. When an
empty markup string is used the entry holds no data thus C<get_text> will return
an empty string.

Parameters:

=over

=item * $markup

The text to add to the entry, the text is expected to be using Pango markup.
Make sure to escape all characters with L<Glib::Markup/escape_text>. For more
details about escaping the markup see L</set_markup>.

=head1 PROPERTIES

The following properties are added by this widget:

=head2 markup

(string: writable)

The markup text used by this widget. This property is a string that's only
writable. That's right, there's no way for extracting the markup from the
widget.

=head2 empty-markup

(string: readable writable)

The markup text used by this widget when the entry field is empty. If this
property is set the entry will display a default string in the widget when
there's no text provided by the user.

=head1 SIGNALS

=head2 markup-changed

Emitted when the markup has been changed.

Signature:

	sub markup_changed {
		my ($widget, $markup) = @_;
		# Returns nothing
	}

Parameters:

=over

=item * $markup

The new markup that's been applied. This field is a normal Perl string. If
C<$markup> is C<undef> then the markup was removed.

=back	

=head2 empty-markup-changed

Emitted when the markup used when the widget is empty has been changed.

Signature:

	sub empty_markup_changed {
		my ($widget, $markup) = @_;
		# Returns nothing
	}

Parameters:

=over

=item * $markup

The new markup that's been applied when the widget is empty. This field is a
normal Perl string. If C<$markup> is C<undef> then the markup was removed.
